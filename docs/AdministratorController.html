    <h1>AdministratorController Documentation</h1>

    <p>
        The AdministratorController class is responsible for managing the administrative functions of the application.
       Has functionality for adding users, deleting users, and listing all users.
       This class also interacts with the IdAndPasswords class to read and write user login information
       and photo albums. This ensures data persistence between sessions.
